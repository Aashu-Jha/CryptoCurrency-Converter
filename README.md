# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What I created

I made a crypto currency price checking app. It fetches realtime data through api-calls to get the latest currency rate of crypto currencies.
It contains three crypto currencies BTC, ETH, LTC and it converts these currencies in more than 20 currencies.
